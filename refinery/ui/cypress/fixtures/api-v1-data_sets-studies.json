      "description": "Caco-2 human intestinal cells are widely used to investigate epithelial functions, intestinal gene expression, and transcriptional mechanisms of differentiation. To identify cis-regulatory sequences associated with Caco-2 cell differentiation, we evaluated a distinct epigenetic pattern attributed to active enhancer elements, abundant H3K4Me2 and H3K27Ac marks. To verify CDX2 binding at enhancer regions we used ChIP-seq to identify CDX2 binding sites. Dynamic CDX2 occupancy corresponds with condition-specific gene expression and to differential occupancy with other tissue-restricted transcription factors: HNFA in mature cells and GATA6 in progenitors. H3K4me2, CDX2, GATA6, and HNF4A ChIP-seq patterns were mapped in proliferating and 26 day post-confluent (differentiated) Caco-2 intestinal cell lines. To determine association of protein binding with gene expression, Caco-2 expression microarray data (Fleet et al., 2003) were enumerated based on log-fold changes in differentiated over proliferating cells.",
