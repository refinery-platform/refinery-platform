  Only data set owners can change sharing options. To share
  with an authenticated user, create a new group or invite the user to an
  existing group <a href='/dashboard'> on the dashboard page's collaboration
  section. </a> Owners can update data set permissions (including making it
  public) on the dashboard by opening a data set preview (click a data set
  link) and then clicking the “sharing” button.
