## Before Coding
For new features and bugs, check to see if there's an existing [open issue](https://github.com/refinery-platform/refinery-platform/issues). Talk to the core team about your ideas via github comments, email, or slack.

#### Reporting a new issue
If no existing issue seems appropriate, create a new issue using [these guidelines](https://github.com/refinery-platform/refinery-platform/wiki/Tracking-Issues-with-the-Github-Issue-Tracker)

#### Set up dev environment
Set up the dev environment locally using the instructions in the [README.MD](https://github.com/refinery-platform/refinery-platform/blob/develop/README.md).

## Coding and Merging
Review and adhere to the team's style guide.
* [Coding-Style-Guide](https://github.com/refinery-platform/refinery-platform/wiki/coding-style-guide)
* [Python](https://github.com/refinery-platform/refinery-platform/wiki/coding-style-guide#python)
* [UI Development](https://github.com/refinery-platform/refinery-platform/wiki/coding-style-guide#angularjs-and-javascript)

#### Pull Request Guidelines
All changes must be submitted by pull requests to this repository. 
* New features or bug fixes should branch off the develop branch.
* With new code, provide unit tests. 
    * [Server-side Testing](https://github.com/refinery-platform/refinery-platform/wiki/Server-side-testing) 
    * [Client-side Testing](https://github.com/refinery-platform/refinery-platform/wiki/Client-side-testing)
* Pull requests should be small and reviewed as you make progress on the feature. Submit them often, so the team can give continuous feedback. 
* Each pull request should include a description of the changes and pass all the continuous integration tests which are automatically run by GitHub using Travis CI.
* Pull requests can either be merged back to the develop branch or to the feature branch. 
* Before merging into develop, all pull requests must be approved by a core team member.
