## Metadata

__Should I provide a tabular or ISA-Tab metadata file?__
  ISA-Tab is the preferred format for Refinery as it allows tracking of relationships between raw and derived data files. Refinery also supports tabular metadata files, but file relationship information is not supported in this case.

__How do I create an ISA-Tab metadata file?__
  Download the latest version of [ISAcreator][isa-creator-releases] and follow along with the [video tutorial][isa-creator-video] to create an ISA Tab archive.

## Data Set Upload

__How do I get my data into Refinery?__
  Follow the [Uploading a Data Set][data-set-upload] section in the Refinery tutorial.

## Collaboration

__How do I share my data with another user?__
  Only data set owners can change sharing options. To share
  with an authenticated user, create a new group or invite the user to an
  existing group on the collaboration page. Owners can update data set permissions (including making it public)
  on the data set preview by clicking the “sharing” button.
