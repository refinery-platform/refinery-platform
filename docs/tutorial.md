# Refinery Tutorial 

Refinery is a data management, analysis, and visualization platform designed to support analysts in managing common tasks in analysis and interpretation of biomedical data. 

In this tutorial you will learn how to load data into Refinery, how to analyze it using workflows, and how to view analysis results using built-in visualization tools. Additionally, this tutorial demonstrates how to work with the data repository, how to use features that are supporting reproducible research, and how to use the collaboration tools of Refinery.

__Preparation__

To follow the steps of this tutorial, you will need a data set consisting of data files and a metadata file that is referencing your files.

__This tutorial can be completed using the Tutorial Data Set, which consists of sample ChIP-seq data ([input control][input.fastq] and [experimental][nanog.fastq] FASTQ files -- download both) and their associated [metadata file][tutorial.tsv]. Follow all steps (except creating a metadata file as it already exists) and note the bullet points after some steps with expanded instructions specific to the Tutorial Data Set.__

## 0. Accessing Refinery
1. Go to the [Refinery Launch Pad][scc-home]
  - __To create a new account__:

    2. Provide the required details and then click the *__Register__* button below
    3. Wait to receive an account activation e-mail at the address provided during registration
  - __To log in to an account__:
    1. Click *__Login__* at the top right of the navigation bar
    2. Enter the *__Username or E-mail__* and *__Password__* provided during registration and click the *__Login__* button below

## 1. Creating a Metadata File
1. Compile all the metadata to be associated with the data set and then organize these metadata into a delimited (e.g. tab-delimited) text file. A template metadata file can be found [here][refinery-sample-metadata.tsv] -- note the required attributes (sample name, data file, and organism). Additional attributes can be appended as needed.
  - __Tutorial Data Set: tab-delimited__ `tutorial.tsv` __metadata file already created__

> __Column Order__: The attribute and file name columns in the metadata file can be provided in any order and the column headers can be chosen by the investigator. However, given that the data set importer (see next section below) will map column 1 to _sample name_, column 2 to _data file_, and column 3 to _organism_, it can save time during import if this information is provided in the first three columns in this order.


> __Column Names__: The column names provided in the metadata file can be freely chosen by the analyst and will be used to identify attributes throughout the Refinery application. They _must be unique_, _must not contain any special characters_, and _should be descriptive yet concise_.

## 2. Uploading a Data Set 
1. From the *__Launch Pad__*, Click *__Upload__* from the *__Data Sets__* panel
![PanelHeaders](https://github.com/refinery-platform/refinery-platform/blob/develop/docs/screenshots/PanelHeaders_Ann.png)
2. First choose delimiter used in the metadata file and then upload the file
  - __Tutorial Data Set: upload tab-delimited__ `tutorial.tsv`
3. Check metadata *__Preview__* for accuracy (note: only first 5 samples are displayed)
4. Review *__Configure Metadata Import__* and make changes as needed
  - __Tutorial Data Set: no changes needed__
5. Click *__Add filesâ€¦__* button under *__Upload Data Files__* and select data files corresponding to the metadata (note: wait for MD5 calculations, which ensure successful data file uploads, to complete)
  - __Tutorial Data Set: upload__ `input.fastq` __and__ `nanog.fastq` __data files__
6. Click *__Start upload__* to begin uploading all selected data files
7. After all data files have uploaded, click *__Check Availability of Data Files__* to confirm all files are now on the Refinery server
8. Click *__Upload Data Set__* to upload the new data set (metadata + data files)

![UploadDataSet](https://github.com/refinery-platform/refinery-platform/blob/develop/docs/screenshots/UploadDataSet_Ann.png)

## 3. Viewing a Data Set Summary in the Data Set Browser
1. Return to the *__Launch Pad__* (Refinery homepage) and click on the newly uploaded data set title. The *__Data Set Browser__* will display a summary of the data set
![DataSetBrowser](https://github.com/refinery-platform/refinery-platform/blob/develop/docs/screenshots/DataSetBrowser_Ann.png)

## 4. Exploring Data Set Contents in the File Browser
1. From the *__Data Set Browser__*, click *__View Content in File Browser__* to view the individual data files belonging to the data set:
  - Files can be filtered based on attributes using the *__Attribute Filter__* in the left-hand panel
  - Files can also be sorted according to attributes (both ascending and descending) by clicking the attribute names (i.e. column headers)
  ![FileBrowser](https://github.com/refinery-platform/refinery-platform/blob/develop/docs/screenshots/FileBrowser_Ann.png)

> __Direct Access of Dataset Content__: The file browser can be launched directly from the data set browser by clicking on the table icon to the right of the dataset name and summary. It is not required to open the preview first.

## 5. Launching an Analysis
1. From the *__File Browser__*, click the *__Analyze__* tab above the left-hand panel
  - __Tutorial Data Set: follow this '5. Launching an Analysis' section twice, first launching the *FastQC* workflow and afterwards the *TF ChIP-seq analysis using MACS2: hg19* workflow (details below)__
